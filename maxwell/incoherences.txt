Mass is said in the morning (not anymore!)
------------------------------------------

It was half past seven on a fine July evening when Father Malone knocked at the front door of Sir John Tribeâ€™s London house. He had hurried round from the Church where he had been saying Mass, so that he would not be late for dinner.

Dinner does not start with apple pie
------------------------------------

Sir John, Father Malone, and Mrs Tribe all went in to dinner, and the butler at once served them with apple pie.

Killed by bullet or by knife
----------------------------

When they were all talking and laughing quite cheerfully, Miss Weaver suddenly gave a terrific shriek and fell forward across the table with a bullet wound through her head. When the others reached her, they found that she was dead, and Sir John at once plucked the blood stained knife from her heart.
